Calculate your personal financial worth with an ipython script

This script calculates the worth of your funds and stocks. Can be used to get a summary of all your financial assets from multiple sources. I made it really simple to make it easy to expand. The assets dict in is where you specify all your assets and also the current value. If you map the current value to a python funciton then it will update each time you run it which is convinient since the worth of stocks and funds fluctuates.
Right now everything converts to SEK but that should be easy to change to whatever.
